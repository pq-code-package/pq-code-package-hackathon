# Project Onboarding

## License Requirements

- Project source should be either under the Apache-2.0 or MIT license
- Documentation should be CC-BY-4.0

## Creating a Github repo

1. Decide on an initial name for the repo. 

    This is expected to be of the form
    ```
    algorithm-language[-optionalplatform][-optionaldescriptor]
    ```
    for example
    ```
    mlkem-assembly-avx2-jasmin
    ```
    See [tsc/11](https://github.com/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/11) for discussion

2. Raise github issue to request repo and access group be created

    - Use the [tsc repo issues](https://github.com/pq-code-package/tsc/issues) to request a new github repository for the project

        - Provide the following information:
            - name
            - description
            - Appropriate access groups:
                - initial list of maintainers
                - initial list of core contributors
                - any other relevant access into
        - anything else relevant...

    - Alternatively in the issue specify the source repo to migrate the code from & engage in a discussion as to the best way to acheive this
