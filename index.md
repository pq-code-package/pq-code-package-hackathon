## About the PQCA

The [PQCA](https://pqca.org)'s goal is to

_To advance the adoption of post-quantum cryptography, by producing high-assurance software implementations of standardized algorithms, and supporting the continued development and standardization of new post-quantum algorithms with software for evaluation and prototyping._

## Who's involved with the PQCA?

Our [members](https://pqca.org/#members) include AWS, Cisco, Google, IBM, NVidia, Information Security Corporation, IntellectEU, Keyfactor, Kudelski group, QRL, QuSecure, SandboxAQ, University of Waterloo

As a [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) project anyone can become involved, whether as contributor, consumer, or just following along with the discussion.

_The Linux Foundation provides a neutral, trusted hub for developers and organizations to code, manage, and scale open technology projects and ecosystems._

## About the PQ Code Package

The project aims to build high-assurance software implementations of standards-track post-quantum cryptography algorithms.

The initial focus is on bringing in ML-KEM implementations, and expect to add ML-DSA and SLH-DSA later.

## About Hackathons

We're eager to get going. There's a lot of excitement and interest in PQCA, and there are many diverse projects out there.


The next tangible step in this journey is to start on-boarding projects & bring them into the PQCA.

To get focussed on this we've setup our initial hackathon & look forward to making great progress
