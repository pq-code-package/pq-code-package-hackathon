## Additional points

- Licensing. Aiming for Apache 2.0 (code) & CC-BY-4.0 (docs). some followups
- Test vectors being investigated - license unknowns (Norm Ashley)
- code flow ?upstream -> pqcp -> liboqs. Pipelines/strategy
- need to have commonality across sub-projects. Swap in/out algorithms. Documentation describing characteristics of implementation
- What is a package? 
- artifact Distribution to repositories (->github)
- github practices - merge/rebase/squash, versioning, forks
- Managing access control groups was redious. post session adopted tooling to help (defined in yaml)

## Next steps
- TSC formation
- continued onboarding & addressing issues
- another hackathon?
