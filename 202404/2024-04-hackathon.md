# March 2024 hackathon

The initial hackathon for the post-quantum code package will take place on Tue 12 March. [QUICKSTART](quickstart.md)



## Objective

We aim to make the [pq-code-package project](https://github.com/pq-code-package) the place to come to for trusted post-quantum standards-oriented cryptographic algorithm implementations.

An important step towards this is to start onboarding [candidate ML-KEM implementations](candidate-projects.md) and making them available in the project:


* Bring anyone interested in ML-KEM implementations together to share ideas
* Create Github repos to manage implementations, and populate these repos with implementation code.
* Get initial ci in place for policy checks, static/security scans,build, test.
* Documenting the project including implementation summaries explaining the characteristics of different implementations.
* Learn from our initial implementations to get an 'examplar' for future implementations.


These are just some initial ideas. This is intended as an open collaboration session and any ideas on how we can effectively use the time are welcome!

## Live session

The core times
are below, but given the geographical spread there may be people available before and after these times.

| Timezone | Start | End |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GMT | 1330 | 2100 |
| CET | 1430 | 2200 |
| EST | 0930 | 1700 |
| PST | 0630 | 1400 |  

During the session core times we will have a [Zoom video conference](https://zoom.us/j/97821311660?pwd=My9rWVRkbHJXbEJHQVc5TGlkNFpyZz09).

There's also a variety of chat channels:
 - [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1202723482224295936/1203396039977996359) - if needed you can [signup here](https://discord.com/invite/xyVnwzfg5R)
 - [Github discussions](https://github.com/orgs/pq-code-package/discussions)

For raising issues around pq-code-package generally:
 - [TSC issues](https://github.com/pq-code-package/tsc)

 As projects onboard, issues can be raised in their own repositories, and we can add new channels in Discord.

## Onboarding projects

- [Licensing/Legal](licensing.md)
- [Github repository](project-onboarding.md)
- [standard files](standard-files.md)
- [build & ci](code-scanning.md)
- [Documentation](docs.md)


## What next?

* look at what went well, and less well during the hackathon, so we can consider running future events
* continue onboarding & developing the hosted projects
* get up and running with a more formal governance model
