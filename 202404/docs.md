# Documentation

To get the PQCA up and running we also need to start building documentation of our processes, as well as the sub projects.


As a starting point, an initial site has been created at [docs.pqcodepackage.org](docs.pqcodepackage.org), but this needs work to adapt to PQCA including rebranding from it's original source (hyperledger). It's based on [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

Any content we place here should be regarded as draft, until the TSC has met, and got to the point of approving (one of the first tasks is to add this disclaimer!)

To get started go to the [pq-code-package/documentation](https://github.com/pq-code-package/documentation) repository.
