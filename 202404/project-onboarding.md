# Project Onboarding

## License Requirements

- Project source should be either under the Apache-2.0 or MIT license
- Documentation should be CC-BY-4.0

Any other license will need legal approval

## Requesting a Github repo

1. Decide on an initial name for the repo (see [tsc/11](https://github.com/pq-code-package/tsc/issues/11)) of the form `algorithm-language[-optionalplatform][-optionaldescriptor]`, for example `mlkem-assembly-avx2-jasmin`

2. Use the [tsc repo issues](https://github.com/pq-code-package/tsc/issues) to request a repository for the implementation including:
   - name
   - description
   - Appropriate access groups:
     - admins
     - maintainers
     - core contributors
   - anything else relevant...

    - Alternatively in the issue specify the source repo to migrate the code from & engage in a discussion as to the best way to achieve this
