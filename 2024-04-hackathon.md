# March 2024 hackathon

The initial hackathon for the post-quantum code package will take place on Tue 12 March. The core times
are below, but given the geographical spread there may be people available before and after these times.

| Timezone | Start | End |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  GMT | 1330 | 2100 |
| CET | 1430 | 2200 |
| EST | 0830 | 1600 |
| PST | 0530 | 1300 |  

## Objective

Thanks for joining the Hackathon. After all of the interest around the PQCA launch, we now want to start making it real by onboarding projects:

* Get contributors involved starting to setup projects for ML-KEM implementations in this GitHub organization
* Create github repos with appropriate teams, permissions, controls, and start populating with code
* Get initial build/compiles working & continue with any additional ci activities such as security scans
* Start documenting the project
* Bring the community together for real-time discussions and help to make this real

## Collaboration

During the session core times we will have a video conference active:
- [zoom](https://zoom.us/j/97821311660?pwd=My9rWVRkbHJXbEJHQVc5TGlkNFpyZz09)

There's also a variety of chat channels:
 - [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1202723482224295936/1203396039977996359) - if needed you can [signup here](https://discord.com/invite/xyVnwzfg5R)
 - [Github discussions](https://github.com/orgs/pq-code-package/discussions)

For raising issues around pq-code-package generally:
 - [TSC issues](https://github.com/pq-code-package/tsc)

 Finally as projects onboard, issues can be raised in their own repositories.
